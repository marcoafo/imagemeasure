# Image Measure

Test project to measure image using a reference. It doesn't consider lens errors and optical errors due o convex image acquisition. It' useful for small measures where the objects can be obtained in constract with a neutral background.

This was made for a small test I took a while ago. Parameters are hard coded as well.

Needs OpenCV (tested in 2.4).
